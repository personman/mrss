<p>Non-credit workforce development refers to courses and other instructional activities that provide individuals with soft skills and/or technical skill-sets for the workplace but carry no institutional credit applicable toward a degree, diploma, or a for-credit certificate.  Offerings may be on-campus, off-campus, online, distance learning or at a specific organization/business.   The goal is to increase individual opportunity in the labor market to improve participants’ knowledge, skills, and abilities and/or provide specific employee training for the benefit of a given business client.</p>

    <p>Colleges should use audited end-of-year expenditures for the fiscal year for the Maximizing Resources for Student Success Project, however colleges may use end of-year estimated expenditures if audited expenditures are not available by the submission date. Please report 2012-2013 fiscal year actual, after audit expenditures.</p>

    <p>General Guidelines</p>

    <p>For the purposes of the Maximizing Resources for Student Success Project a fiscal year includes the summer session as the first term, the fall term, the winter term (if applicable), and the spring term. The fiscal year should include a full 12 months for both the production of credit hours and for expenditures. Only expenditures for the fiscal year should be reported. The accounting guidelines in the Budget Guide should be followed. In addition, the following specific guidelines should be used:</p>

    <ol><li>Summer School - Summer school will be treated as the first term of the fiscal year. All
    summer school salaries and accounts payable will be accrued to the fiscal year of the
    summer school.</li>
    <li>Teacher Salaries - Teacher salaries paid after the close of the fiscal year for work done
    in the prior fiscal year will be accrued to the prior fiscal year.</li>
    <li>Accounts Payable - Materials and services for the past fiscal year will be accrued to that
    year.</li>
    <li>Transfers - Do not report transfer.</li>
    <li>Encumbrances - End-of-year encumbrances should not be included in Maximizing Resources for Student Success Project. These encumbrances should be reported in the subsequent year’s report.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Finally, do not hesitate to e-mail or call us if you have questions or encounter data entry problems.  Thank you for your participation in the Maximizing Resources for Student Success Project.</p>

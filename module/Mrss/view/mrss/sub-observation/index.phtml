    Report this information at the for-credit instructional academic unit level (such as division) that fits your organization.<br>

    Leaders (typically deans) of each academic unit may provide this information. <a href="/data-entry/import">The download Excel file</a> has sheets that can be distributed to the heads of your academic units.<br>

    You may report up to ten academic units. Use the Add an Academic Unit button to generate a page to report for another academic unit. If you are unable to report by academic unit, you should report for your entire institution.

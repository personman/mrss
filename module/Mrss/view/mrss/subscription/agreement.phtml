<strong>Institution data will be confidential</strong>. Except as required by law and as set forth in this Agreement, data submitted to the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> by subscribers, including institutional course load and instructional cost information (Data Template Parts A and B), will be confidential. <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> staff will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the individual subscriber's identifying information --including, but not limited to, IPEDS ID, institution name, institution address, and contact information --will not be associated with benchmark data submitted by that institution, except to the institution itself and <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> staff. Peer-comparison reports generated by the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> web site only name the subscriber requesting the peer report and will present accompanying benchmark data for peer institutions anonymously. No fewer than five (5) institutions will comprise a peer group, for the purposes of the peer-comparison reports made available to subscribers.
<br>
<br>
<?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> staff will, from time to time, provide data to non-subscribing institutions. When data are provided to non-subscribers, only aggregate benchmark data will be provided; no individual institutional data with identifying information will be included. All requests for <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> data from non-subscribers should be forwarded to <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> staff at Johnson County Community College and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> reserves the right to provide data, including aggregate data and data with subscribers' identifying information, to outside entities for research and analytical purposes. In the event that the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> releases data with subscribers' identifying information, <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> will require the outside entity receiving the information to be subject to the same or similar confidentiality terms as contained herein.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Data will be accurate</strong>. <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> will make reasonable efforts to ensure that data it includes in its database and reports are accurate. Subscribing institutions, on their part, shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that their data are accurate, and they will avail themselves actively of opportunities to review their data and make corrections before data reporting deadlines.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Data are for subscribers' use</strong>. Data, institutional and aggregate, and reports provided by <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> are for use by subscribing institutions. Subscribing institutions agree that they will not allow access to institutional or aggregate data by unauthorized individuals or other non-subscribers to review, generate benchmark information, learn identities of subscribing institutions, or make peer comparisons for commercial, competitive, or any other purposes. <strong><?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> aggregate data reports, specifically including the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> national means, can be used by institutions to support institutional purposes, but full aggregate reports shall not be posted to web sites accessible to the general public or made otherwise available to non-subscribing institutions or individuals. The aggregate data reports are the intellectual property of <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> and shall NOT be considered public record</strong>.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Information and data can be published</strong>. This Agreement is not intended to preclude publication of subscribers' identifying information to verify participation in <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> and to facilitate peer comparison. Neither is this agreement intended to preclude publication or presentation of aggregate benchmark data for research and analytical purposes.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Liability and Indemnification</strong>. By executing this Agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable law, subscriber agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the data sources and <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> and Johnson County Community College from any and all claims and losses accruing to any person, organization, or other legal entity as a result of a violation of this Agreement. The <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> staff and Johnson County Community College assume no responsibility for inferences and conclusions drawn from <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> data by others. There are no intended third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Attribution</strong>. Subscribers shall provide to the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> Project Director an abstract and reference for any published research material resulting from the use of the <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> data. Subscribers shall acknowledge in all publications and presentations based on <?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?> data, whether internal or external, that the source of the data is the "<?= $this->currentStudy()->getDescription() ?>."

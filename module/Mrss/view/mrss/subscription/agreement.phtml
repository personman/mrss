    <strong>Institution data will be confidential</strong>. Except as required by law and as set forth in this Agreement, data submitted to the Maximizing Resources for Student Success by subscribers, including institutional course load and instructional cost information (Data Template Parts A and B), will be confidential. Maximizing Resources for Student Success staff will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the individual subscriber's identifying information --including, but not limited to, IPEDS ID, institution name, institution address, and contact information --will not be associated with benchmark data submitted by that institution, except to the institution itself and Maximizing Resources for Student Success staff. Peer-comparison reports generated by the Maximizing Resources for Student Success web site only name the subscriber requesting the peer report and will present accompanying benchmark data for peer institutions anonymously. No fewer than five (5) institutions will comprise a peer group, for the purposes of the peer-comparison reports made available to subscribers.
    <br>
    <br>
    Maximizing Resources for Student Success staff will, from time to time, provide data to non-subscribing institutions. When data are provided to non-subscribers, only aggregate benchmark data will be provided; no individual institutional data with identifying information will be included. All requests for Maximizing Resources for Student Success data from non-subscribers should be forwarded to Maximizing Resources for Student Success staff at Johnson County Community College (Kansas) and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    <br>
    <br>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Maximizing Resources for Student Success reserves the right to provide data, including aggregate data and data with subscribers' identifying information, to outside entities for research and analytical purposes. In the event that the Maximizing Resources for Student Success releases data with subscribers' identifying information, Maximizing Resources for Student Success will require the outside entity receiving the information to be subject to the same or similar confidentiality terms as contained herein.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Data will be accurate</strong>. Maximizing Resources for Student Success will make reasonable efforts to ensure that data it includes in its database and reports are accurate. Subscribing institutions, on their part, shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that their data are accurate, and they will avail themselves actively of opportunities to review their data and make corrections before data reporting deadlines.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Data are for subscribers' use</strong>. Data, institutional and aggregate, and reports provided by Maximizing Resources for Student Success are for use by subscribing institutions. Subscribing institutions agree that they will not allow access to institutional or aggregate data by unauthorized individuals or other non-subscribers to review, generate benchmark information, learn identities of subscribing institutions, or make peer comparisons for commercial, competitive, or any other purposes. <strong>Maximizing Resources for Student Success aggregate data reports, specifically including the Maximizing Resources for Student Success national means, can be used by institutions to support institutional purposes, but full aggregate reports shall not be posted to web sites accessible to the general public or made otherwise available to non-subscribing institutions or individuals.

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information and data can be published</strong>. This Agreement is not intended to preclude publication of subscribers' identifying information to verify participation in Maximizing Resources for Student Success and to facilitate peer comparison.

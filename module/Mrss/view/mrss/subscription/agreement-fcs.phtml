<h1>DATA CONFIDENTIALITY AND USE AGREEMENT</h1>

<p><strong>Data Use and Confidentiality.</strong> Individual (unit-record) data submitted to the Faculty Compensation Survey by respondents and institutions will be confidential.  Institutional data submitted to the Faculty Compensation Survey will be publically available through a public website maintained by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), publication in Academe, through media publication partner Inside Higher Ed, as well as others who may be able to publically access that content.  Faculty Compensation Survey staff will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the individual subscriber's identifying information --including, but not limited to, individual information such as contact information --will not be associated with benchmark data submitted by that institution, except to the institution itself and Faculty Compensation Survey staff. Peer-comparison reports generated by the Faculty Compensation Survey site only name the subscriber requesting the peer report and will present accompanying benchmark data for peer institutions anonymously. No fewer than five (5) institutions will comprise a peer group, for the purposes of the peer-comparison reports made available to subscribers.</p>

<p>Faculty Compensation Survey staff will, from time to time, provide data to non-participating institutions. When data are provided to non-subscribers, only aggregate benchmark data will be provided; no individual institutional data with identifying information will be included. All requests for Faculty Compensation Survey data from non-subscribers should be forwarded to Faculty Compensation Survey staff at AAUP and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Faculty Compensation Survey reserves the right to provide data, including aggregate data to outside entities for research and planning purposes. In the event that the Faculty Compensation Survey releases data with subscribers' identifying information, Faculty Compensation Survey will require the outside entity receiving the information to be subject to the same or similar confidentiality terms as contained herein.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Data Accuracy.</strong> AAUP will make reasonable efforts to ensure that data it includes in its database and reports are accurate. Subscribing institutions, on their part, shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that their data are accurate, and they will avail themselves actively of opportunities to review their data and make corrections before data reporting deadlines.</p>

<p><strong>Data Use.</strong> Data, institutional and aggregate, and reports provided by Faculty Compensation Survey are intended for the internal use of the requesting institution.  Internal use includes posting on a secure institutional website that is not publically viewable, and the transmission to employees and contractors of the institution for use in planning and decision-making.</p>

<p>Commercial use of these data are prohibited.  Please do not publish or redistribute these data without permission of the AAUP Research Office (E-mail: aaupfcs@aaup.org)</p>

<p>Subscribing institutions agree that they will not allow access to institutional or aggregate data by unauthorized individuals or other non-subscribers to review, generate benchmark information, learn identities of subscribing institutions, or make peer comparisons for commercial, competitive, or any other purposes.  <strong>Faculty Compensation Survey aggregate data reports, specifically including the Faculty Compensation Survey national means, can be used by institutions to support institutional purposes, but full aggregate reports shall not be posted to web sites accessible to the general public or made otherwise available to non-subscribing institutions or individuals. The aggregate data reports are the intellectual property of Faculty Compensation Survey and shall NOT be considered public record.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Liability and Indemnification.</strong> By executing this Agreement, subscriber agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the data sources and Faculty Compensation Survey and the AAUP from any and all claims and losses accruing to any person, organization, or other legal entity as a result of a violation of this Agreement. AAUP staff assume no responsibility for inferences and conclusions drawn from Faculty Compensation Survey data by others. There are no intended third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution.</strong> Subscribers shall provide to the Faculty Compensation Survey Research Office an abstract and reference for any published research material resulting from the use of the Faculty Compensation Survey data. Subscribers shall acknowledge in all publications and presentations based on Faculty Compensation Survey data, whether internal, or external, that the source of these data are the "Faculty Compensation Survey."</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgements of Faculty Compensation Survey Agreement.</strong> I agree that my institution will abide by the confidentiality and use agreement set out above --including the provision regarding the posting of Faculty Compensation Survey reports that makes them available to non-subscribers --and I understand that my institution will pay an annual subscription fee of $0 for our participation in the Faculty Compensation Survey.</p>

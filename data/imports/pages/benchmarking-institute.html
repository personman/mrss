        <p>The National Community College Benchmark Project (NCCBP) is one of <a href="/projects">four projects</a> that grew out of the National Higher Education Benchmarking Institute at Johnson County Community College.</p>

        <p>Since 2004, nearly 500 two-year institutions have participated in the data-collection and reporting process for the benchmarking institute&rsquo;s projects. These projects and that level of participation make the Benchmarking Institute&nbsp;the first and largest provider of community college benchmarking and peer comparison services in the nation.</p>

        <h3>Benchmark Beginnings</h3>

        <p>NHEBI&rsquo;s foundation was laid more than 11 years ago. Initial funding was received from the Department of Educations&rsquo; Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE).</p>

        <p>This funding established &quot;The Kansas Study,&rdquo; which we now call the&nbsp;<a href="https://costandproductivity.org/">Cost and Productivity Project</a>. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href="/" title="NCCBP | The National Community College Benchmark Project - Accountability For Community Colleges">National Community College Benchmark Project (NCCBP)</a>&nbsp;was conceived to take a &ldquo;balanced scorecard&rdquo; approach to community college benchmarking.</p>

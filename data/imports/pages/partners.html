<p>Consistent with the American Institutes for Research&rsquo;s larger mission to make research relevant, the <a href="http://deltacostproject.org/">Delta Cost Project</a> at AIR provides policy makers, high education administrators and the general public with analyses and resources to deepen understanding of how colleges spend money. It focuses on the spending part of college affordability &ndash; how spending relates to access and success, and ways that costs can be controlled without compromising quality. Delta Cost reports analyze the latest data in college revenues, spending, subsidies and outcomes; compare academic spending to athletic spending; and debunk myths centered on the causes of rising tuition.</p>

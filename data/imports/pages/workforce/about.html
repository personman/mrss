        <p>The Non-credit Education and&nbsp;Workforce Training Benchmark Project provides community colleges with national metrics<span face=""> to express their continuing education&nbsp;division productivity and successes to internal and external stakeholders. </span></p>

        <p>Workforce Training and Continuing Education divisions across the country are under pressure to demonstrate their effectiveness. Divisions strive to establish a culture of evidence in which indicators of performance are regularly reviewed and data are collected to inform decision-making, planning, and improvement. This&nbsp;Benchmark Project&nbsp;offers community colleges consistent measures to express non-credit education and workforce training&nbsp;efficacy.</p>

        <p>The Non-credit Education and Workforce Training Benchmark&nbsp;Project was developed by the <a href="/National-Higher-Education-Benchmarking-Institute">National Higher Education Benchmarking Institute</a> at Johnson County Community College with input from over 20 community college across the country. &nbsp;It&nbsp;is a national initiative to collect standardized information from community college continuing education divisions.</p>

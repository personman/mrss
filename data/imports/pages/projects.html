        <h2>Maximizing Resources for Student Success</h2>

        <p>Maximizing Resources is the first national fiscal benchmarking project to examine community college costs and student outcomes in concert. &nbsp;This will allow colleges to align spending on instructional and student services costs with their priorities while considering their impact on student success.</p>

        <p>The Benchmarking Institute is creating this costing framework with its partners at the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS).</p>

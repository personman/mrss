        <p>NCCBP’s 150+ <a href="/benchmarks">benchmarks</a> were developed by institutional researchers, for institutional researchers. Over the past 10 years, we’ve perfected those benchmarks to reflect the unique character and missions of America’s community colleges. </p>

        <p>Researchers use the data to their community colleges’ performance against peer institutions, identify opportunities for improvement, and communicate their schools’ commitment to their students and academic mission. </p>

        <p>Each year at our annual <a href="http://www.jccc.edu/benchmark/">benchmarking conference</a>, community colleges share their <a href="http://www.jccc.edu/benchmark/2014-presentations.html">best practices</a>, showing how they use benchmarks, for example, to meet performance-based funding requirements, improve student persistence rates, and coordinate data across college systems.</p>

            <p>NCCBP has been a valuable resource for analyzing regional data.  The institutional ranking  and percentile comparisons identified significant economic challenges facing our students.  Currently, we are using the data as a foundation for formulating regional policy to address these issues.</p>

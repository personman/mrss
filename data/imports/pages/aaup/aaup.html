        <h2>Mission</h2>

        <p>The mission of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is to advance academic freedom and shared governance; to define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education; to promote the economic security of faculty, academic professionals, graduate students, post‚Äêdoctoral fellows, and all those engaged in teaching and research in higher education; to help the higher education community organize to make our goals a reality; and to ensure higher education&#39;s contribution to the common good. Founded in 1915, the AAUP has helped to shape American higher education by developing the standards and procedures that maintain quality in education and academic freedom in this country&#39;s colleges and universities.</p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>

        <p>The AAUP&nbsp;is organized into three interlocked entities under one AAUP umbrella: the AAUP (a professional association), the <a href="http://www.aaupcbc.org/">AAUP-CBC </a>(a labor union), and the <a href="http://www.aaupfoundation.org/">AAUP Foundation</a> (a foundation).</p>

        <p>This organization aligns AAUP&#39;s legal status with their evolving activities, their evolving membership, and their ambitious aims for future programs and services.</p>

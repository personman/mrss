<p>The AAUP research program tracks trends in higher education and produces reports on topics including faculty compensation, academic labor, and gender equity in academia.</p>

<h2>Custom Data Reports for AAUP Chapters</h2>

<p>Active AAUP chapters may request custom reports on full-time faculty compensation, institutional staffing (instructional and non-instructional), gender equity, and institutional finances. There are two basic report formats: institutional profiles, which provide data for a single institution over time, and peer comparisons, which provide the most recent data available for a set of institutions.

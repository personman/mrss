<p>The Faculty Compensation Survey is conducted annually by the <a href="http://www.aaup.org/">American Associaton of University Professors</a>.  It is the largest independent source of data on both full-time and part-time faculty salaries and benefits.  The survey is open to both two- and four-year United States colleges and universities.  The study collects data on more than 375,000 faculty members from over 1,100 institutions.  All 50 states and Puerto Rico are represented.  Learn how to become a part of this important research.  The Annual Report on the Economic Staus of the Profession based on the FCS is published in the March-April issue of <em>Academe</em>, the AAUP magazine.</p>

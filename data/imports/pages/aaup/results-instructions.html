<p>The results portal consists of three sections that allow users to create peer comparisons, build custom reports, and view national reports. &nbsp;If you are only interested in reviewing the national benchmarks (variables), please skip down and review that section of the instructions first. &nbsp;For most users, it might make sense to start by creating a peer group first followed by conducting peer comparisons.</p>


<h2>Peer Comparison Reports</h2>

<p>Peer comparisons are different than peer groups, although the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. &nbsp;The peer comparison tool (found under the &quot;Peer Comparison&quot; &nbsp;menu under the &quot;Results&quot; tab, allows the users to select users based upon user selected criteria. Before conducting peer comparisons you will first need to populate the peer institution field by creating at least one peer group. You can do so by clicking on &ldquo;Manage your peer groups&rdquo; at the bottom of the page.</p>

</p>

<p>From this &ldquo;Manage Peer Groups&rdquo; overview, you can add, edit, or delete peer groups. To start, click &ldquo;Add a peer group&rdquo; and then assign a reference name for the peer group and then click &ldquo;Save.&rdquo; After you&rsquo;re redirected back to the overview page, click the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; button. To add peers, we offer two choices:</p>

        <strong>Individual Peer </strong> If you want to add a specific school, clicking &ldquo;Add an Individual Peer&rdquo; will allow you to search and select peers one by one, either by scrolling down or by typing the name in and searching. You will need to click &ldquo;save&rdquo; after each. Once your peer list is completed, you can navigate back to the Peer Comparison page at <a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://research.aaup.org/reports/peer&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1464033475432000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAPIlOqVBA5_f9V3pASh8yFTsHSA">https://research.aaup.org/reports/peer</a> &nbsp;and continue reading the instructions below for &ldquo;Using Benchmarks to Complete Custom Reports.&rdquo;

        <strong>Demographic Peer Comparison </strong> This allows you to select a number of criteria to automatically generate a peer list. You would click on each variable that you wish to include to create your

<p>For instance, if you are trying to find all Public doctoral schools in the state of California, you would select &ldquo;California&rdquo; in state, &ldquo;Public&rdquo; in Institutional Control, and &ldquo;Doctoral&rdquo; in AAUP Institutional Category.</p>

<p>If you wish to select multiple metrics within a single field, you can do so by pressing <strong>&ldquo;Ctrl&rdquo;</strong> while clicking. This function enables you to include multiple states, categories, controls in your peer list generator.</p>

</p>

<p>Once you click &ldquo;continue&rdquo; - you will now have your generated demographic criteria and will be redirected to select your benchmarks.</p>

<h2>Using Benchmarks to Create Comparison Reports</h2>

<p>From here, you can choose the benchmarks that you will to use as a comparison. You may select multiple benchmarks by holding <strong>&ldquo;Ctrl&rdquo;</strong> as you click each one.</p>

<p><em>If you selected demographic criteria</em>: That information will appear at the top of the page.</p>

<p><em>If you did not choose demographic criteria</em>: You will simply select a benchmark and then any specific peer institution you wish to additionally include.</p>

<p>Your results will be displayed with a bar graph on the left and a spreadsheet style numerical list on the right. This data can be exported to numerous formats, including .csv and .xls by clicking on the button in the top right corner of the bar graph.</p>

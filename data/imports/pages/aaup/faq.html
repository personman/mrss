    <p>Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about the FCS.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<p><b>Form&nbsp;1. Faculty Salary, Number, and Tenure</b></p>

<p><i>Inclusions/Exclusions/Ranks</i></p>

<p><b>Shouldn&#39;t associate and assistant deans be included?</b></p>

<p>These positions vary from institution to institution. In some cases, they are essentially full-time faculty positions with a reduced teaching load, in other cases they are administrative appointments with faculty rank. If the situation at your institution is more like the former, you should include associate and assistant deans in the survey, but remove any additional administrative stipend from the reported salary amounts.</p>

<p><b>Should we include teaching post-doctoral and pre-doctoral fellows? Both types of fellows are employed in full-time term positions and carry the faculty rank of &quot;Lecturer.&quot; Postdoctoral teaching fellows teach two courses per year and are engaged in research for the complement of their contracts. They are compensated at the level of an assistant professor. Pre-doctoral teaching fellows teach one course per year and are engaged in research for the complement of their contracts. They are compensated at the level of an instructor (ABD).</b></p>

<p>This one is really a judgment call. Although these are clearly full-time positions, based on this description they fall below our basic threshold of 50% of duties related to instruction; these are more like research fellows who teach some classes. So they should not be included in our survey.</p>

<p><b>How do you define &quot;Instructor,&quot; &quot;Lecturer,&quot; and those who are considered &quot;No Rank&quot; or &quot;Unranked&quot; faculty?</b></p>

<p>Your response should be based on the ranks you actually use at your institution. If you do not use the ranks of &quot;Instructor&quot; or &quot;Lecturer,&quot; you do not need to report them. If you do use faculty ranks, but have some faculty who do not fit into the assigned categories, you may use the &quot;No Rank&quot; category. &quot;No Rank&quot; is intended for individuals considered faculty who do not have an assigned rank, but where ranks are otherwise used. (Some institutions use this category for clinical or research faculty; however, the intention is to reflect the practice at your institution.)</p>

<p>Note that the survey includes full-time positions only.</p>

<p>If your institution does not use faculty rank at all, for example if all faculty members are referred to as &quot;instructors,&quot; report all faculty on the &quot;No Rank&quot; line. Associate-degree colleges not utilizing ranks are in institutional category IV; others will be footnoted for publication. These institutions are listed in appendix II of the published AAUP report.</p>

<p><i>Tenure status</i></p>

<p><b>What changed for reporting tenure status beginning with 2003-04?</b></p>

<p>Beginning with the 2003-04 survey, institutions are asked to report full-time faculty counts in three mutually-exclusive categories: &quot;Not on tenure track,&quot; &quot;On tenure track,&quot; and &quot;Tenured.&quot; Institutions that do not have a tenure system should report all faculty in the &quot;Not on tenure track&quot; column.</p>

<p>In previous years, the data form asked for the number of tenured faculty in one column, and then a combined number of tenured and tenure-track in a second column. In combination with the total number of faculty, this allowed for a calculation of the number in each of the three categories above, but the combined column was confusing to many respondents.</p>

<p>The revised format should be clearer, and also emphasizes that the survey does include full-time faculty who are not on a tenure track. The three categories also follow the IPEDS definition.</p>

<p><b>Form&nbsp;2. Benefits</b></p>

<p><i>General questions</i></p>

<p><b>How should we count the number of persons receiving benefits?</b></p>

<p>In Section 2, the &quot;number covered&quot; for each benefit is the number of faculty members (of those reported in Section I) for whom a benefit amount was paid. For tuition especially, this is only the number of <i>faculty</i> for whom a tuition amount was (or will be) actually paid in a given year--not the number who were potentially eligible to receive such payments. Note that the number is of faculty, not a total number of persons (dependents) covered.</p>

<p><b>For all benefits, do I just multiply one month&#39;s worth to get the full year?</b></p>

<p>We recognize that benefit expenditures will be an estimate, so this would be one good way to produce such an estimate.</p>

<p><b>We have faculty with full-time contracts who, as part of this year&#39;s service, may direct an academic program. They receive a $5,000 stipend for doing so, added to their full-time contract, taxed and paid across the entire year. This stipend is not an &quot;extra&quot; like overload pay. It is &quot;extra&quot; to their function as a faculty member at a particular rank, but not in terms of their employment at the university for the academic year. All our employer-paid benefits are based off of this amount (contract $ + stipend $). So, pulling out the stipend amount from major benefits info would prove quite challenging.</b></p>

<p>This stipend for directing an academic program seems analogous to the way stipends for department chairs and/or division directors are handled at many other institutions. Ideally, we would like the salary amount reported without the stipend for additional administrative responsibilities. However, that might impose an additional reporting burden, especially with the calculation of benefits. It would actually probably be worse to remove the stipend from the salary, but leave in the higher amount of benefits, as that would then increase the benefits as a percentage of salary.</p>

<p>Our best answer, then, would be that ideally we would prefer to have the administrative stipend removed from both salary and benefits, but that we will certainly accept the most accurate information you are able to provide.</p>

<p><i>Questions on specific benefits</i></p>

<p><b>Retirement</b> should not include any projected amounts for post-retirement benefits, even though these are shown on institutional budget and financial statements. Amounts paid to retired faculty should also not be included. We are looking for actual expenditures for current faculty.</p>

<p>Contributions to the Emeriti plan (or similar plans to provide for faculty health care after a future retirement) paid by the institution on behalf of active faculty members who are reported in section 1 of our survey should be included in the section 2 benefits figures under Retirement. The Emeriti plan is not a retirement pension; however, the accounts will provide for health care once the faculty member is retired, and that is why it should be included in the retirement line. Only the institution&#39;s contribution should be included.</p>

<p><b>Disability: Your instructions state that Line 3 (Disability) of Section II should include &quot;...long-term disability income protection....&quot; Why are short-term disability benefits not to be included in the Survey?</b></p>

<p>On the benefits section of our survey, we try to maintain compatibility with the definitions used by the US Department of Education for IPEDS. Our survey instruction on this point was taken directly from the IPEDS definition. &quot;Long-term&quot; is defined as &quot;in excess of six months.&quot;</p>

<p>As more institutions add short-term disability benefits to bridge the gap between sick leave and long-term disability insurance, we may want to reconsider our definition for future surveys. We will do this in consultation with the Department of Education and other researchers and institutional practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Tuition: We don&#39;t have figures yet for what will be spent for the academic year. Since it&#39;s on a per-person basis and isn&#39;t available until after the end of the fall semester (for the fall figures), how do you want me to list it? Should I use the previous year&#39;s figures instead?</b></p>

<p>Rather than waiting for fall semester figures to be final, please try to estimate the tuition expenditure based on the previous year&#39;s figures and enter survey data as soon as it is otherwise ready. You will have opportunities to make corrections. It will be faster for us to correct one set of figures (tuition) later than to enter the entire survey at that time.</p>

<p><b>Workers&#39; Compensation</b> - The amount to be reported on the survey is the premium paid, not the actual benefits paid to individuals with claims. Workers&#39; compensation is actually a form of insurance. Although all states require some type of workers&#39; compensation insurance for qualifying employers, the actual coverage and the forms the insurance may take vary from state to state. Premiums for workers&#39; compensation will be part of a business insurance package. Some states offer (or even require participation in) state-sponsored plans, and some states may also levy a tax on premiums. (If so, include that tax as well.)</p>

<p><b>Unemployment</b> - Although frequently labeled &quot;unemployment insurance&quot; (UI), employers are required to pay this tax by both federal and state law. Federal unemployment tax (FUTA) is reported on IRS Form 940 or 940EZ. The Federal rate for unemployment insurance is 6.2% on only the first $7,000 of an employee&#39;s wages; this rate has remained steady since at least 1996. State rates and the wage base for taxation vary. Payments for state unemployment taxes can be offset against the federal tax, meaning that the effective total rate for most employers is 6.2% of the first $7,000 of wages, and slightly higher in those states with a higher taxable wage base. Respondents should report the combined Federal and State expenditures, using actual figures where possible and an estimate otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Other Benefits</b> is not intended to include amounts for housing, although that is a significant item for a small number of institutions in specific locations. The IPEDS Faculty Salaries survey has included a separate line item for housing, but the AAUP survey has not. To maintain the continuity of data, housing should not be included.</p>

<p>The instructions for this item state that &quot;the objective is the measurement of income available for personal consumption, as distinct from professional purposes.&quot; Therefore, payments for travel to conferences, research grants or stipends, and professional membership dues should not be included.</p>

<p><b>Form&nbsp;5. Administrative Compensation</b></p>

<p>Note that figures for individual positions at specific institutions will not be published or distributed.</p>

<p>For the &quot;supplement&quot; item in compensation for each administrative position, we are looking for additional direct compensation supplementing the base salary, including bonuses or deferred compensation, which might come from the institution itself, directly from the state government, or from an affiliated private foundation. It is not intended to include housing, entertainment, or travel allowances or general expense accounts, club memberships or tuition allowances for dependents.</p>

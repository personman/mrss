<h2>Instructions for the online survey software</h2>

<p>You may read instructions and download the Excel data form without logging in.</p>

<p><b>Registration (for new users only)</b> If you are not certain whether you are registered in our system, try the &quot;Forgot Password&quot; link first. If you are a new data contact for the survey, an existing data contact can register you in the system using the &quot;Add a colleague&quot; function (under &quot;My Account&quot; in the menu). If this procedure is not available, click &quot;Register&quot; on the survey home page. Complete the required information, including designating an institution, and save. Existing survey data contacts will first be checked. If there is no conflict, your registration request will be submitted to AAUP Research for approval, and you will be notified by e-mail when your registration has been approved.</p>

<p><b>Login</b> Log in using your e-mail address and password. If you have forgotten your password, click the &quot;Forgot Password&quot; link and it will be e-mailed to you. Passwords are case-sensitive.</p>

<p><b>My Profile</b> Prior to beginning data entry for a survey, please verify your personal contact information in the &quot;My Profile&quot; section.</p>

<p><b>Two options for data entry:</b> (1) Excel data file upload. You may upload data directly from the Excel data form using Web services. (2) Data entry by hand. <i>See instructions for each method below.</i></p>

<p><b>Beginning Data Entry</b></p>

<p>Whichever data entry option you choose, begin data entry as follows:</p>

<p><b>Open/Edit Survey</b> When you click the option &quot;Open/Edit Survey&quot; from the Survey menu, you will see a list of institutions for which you have an assigned role. Verify that you have the correct level of access to data for your institution; if this is not correct, you can change or add permissions in the &quot;My Profile&quot; section. Some changes require approval from AAUP Research.</p>

<p>Click the link for the institution whose data you want to use. This will take you to the &quot;Survey Overview&quot; screen for that institution.</p>

<p><b>Survey Overview</b> To begin data entry on a new survey, click the &quot;Start New Survey for Current Year&quot; button. The Survey Overview screen gives you the overall status for the survey (&quot;Not Started,&quot; &quot;In Process,&quot; &quot;Submitted for Approval,&quot; &quot;Further Review Needed,&quot; &quot;Approved,&quot; or &quot;Disapproved&quot;) and a status for each section (&quot;Not Started,&quot; &quot;Started,&quot; &quot;Further Review Needed,&quot; or &quot;Signed off&quot;).</p>

<p><b>Survey Summary Report</b> You can use this link to generate a PDF summary report of data you have submitted and the calculated figures to be used for the published AAUP report. (<b>Note:</b> The report will not display properly on the screen using Firefox. However, you may export it to a PDF file and save to your computer.)</p>

<p><b>Institutional Information Section</b> Before proceeding to upload or enter data in other sections, complete and sign off the institutional information section using the instructions linked below.</p>

<p><b>Instructions for Data Upload</b></p>

<p>Begin by downloading the 2014-15 Excel data entry form; choose &quot;Survey&quot; from the menu and &quot;Download Data Form&quot; for either the 32- or 64-bit file, depending on your version of Excel. If you are using Excel for Mac, you will need to enter data by hand; see below.</p>

<p>Complete the Excel file using the instructions for each section linked below. After each section is complete, click the &quot;Validate&quot; button (upper right corner; upper left in section 2).</p>

<p><b>Note on copy/paste in the Excel file:</b> Improperly formatted data may create problems for the validation checks and formulas built into the Excel file. For best results, if you want to copy data into the Excel file from another source, including another Excel file, use only the &quot;Paste Values&quot; function. If you paste in values with decimal points or commas, the file may not function properly. If you need help with this feature, please contact AAUP Research.</p>

<p>When all sections are complete, check the final tab of the file labeled &quot;Validity checks.&quot; This section indicates any basic problems with the data. Make any corrections necessary. If there are no issues to correct, return to the tab for section 1 and save the file.</p>

<p>Prior to uploading data, you must first start the survey for the current year (described above) and sign off on the institutional information section (complete instructions linked below). Once the institutional information section is signed off, the Survey Overview page will display the message &quot;Excel data can be uploaded to the application.&quot;</p>

<p>Return to the Excel file and click the &quot;Upload Data&quot; button; you will be asked for your user ID (e-mail address) and password again to verify the upload. Note any messages of validation or upload issues and make corrections until the upload is successful. You will need to refresh the survey overview page in your browser to see the result of the upload.</p>

<p><b>Instructions for Data Entry By Hand</b></p>

<p>Each section of the survey is entered and saved separately; you may save a partial survey and return later. The application will total columns and calculate averages once you click &quot;Save.&quot; There are scroll bars for each data section, if the entire section is not visible on your screen.</p>

<p><b>Excel data form:</b> Even if entering data online by hand, we strongly recommend that you enter data into the Excel file first. The Excel file has a number of built-in data validity checks, will make online entry simpler, and will give you a local record of the data you submit. Download the 2014-15 non-upload file by choosing &quot;Survey,&quot; &quot;Download Data Form,&quot; and &quot;Template Not For Upload.&quot;</p>

<p>Complete the Excel file using the instructions for each section linked below. After each section is complete, click the &quot;Validate&quot; button (upper right corner; upper left in section 2). When all sections are complete, check the final tab of the file labeled &quot;Validity checks.&quot; This section indicates any basic problems with the data. Make any necessary corrections.</p>

<p><b>Order of sections</b> Although it is not necessary to enter the sections in order, please verify and correct institutional information first, since some data validation is based on institutional categories. Next, enter section 1 data, since this forms the basis for comparison for the remaining sections.</p>

<p><b>Quality Review (Validation) in the Web application</b></p>

<p>Each data section provides an automatic validation following data upload and each time you save. If there are possible errors or unexpected values, messages will appear in the &quot;Quality Review&quot; section. If there are no issues, you should see a message &quot;No errors or warnings.&quot; If you make any changes in the data, be sure to click &quot;save&quot; and review any messages before exiting the screen. You may use the comment section to explain any unresolved messages.</p>

<p>Once you have uploaded or entered complete data for a section, reviewed any validation messages and made any necessary corrections or comments, click the check box labeled &quot;I confirm that this section is complete and accurate.&quot; This will change the status of the section to &quot;Signed Off.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Understanding the Validation Messages</b></p>

<p>Validation messages are organized by survey section and by priority. There are five categories of message priority, as follows (in order of increasing severity): Notice; Warning; Possible Error; Probable Error; and Abort Data Entry (Contact AAUP).</p>

<p><b>Notice:</b> Indicates that no errors or warnings were found in a particular section.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Messages in this category indicate that data values fall outside generally expected ranges, data for sections 3-5 are missing, or that data are reported in unexpected combinations of rank categories.</p>

<p><b>Possible Error:</b> Messages in this category indicate apparent extreme values in any section.</p>

<p><b>Probable Error:</b> Messages in this category must be resolved before the data can be completely processed. They include no data entered for Section 2; conditions where counts in various survey sections do not match; or extreme values that are likely due to data entry error.</p>

<p><b>Abort Data Entry (Contact AAUP):</b> At present, the only condition generating this level of error message is no data entered in Section 1.</p>

<p>All messages specify the survey section where the problem is found. Most messages are specific to the rank and contract length (9- or 12-month); gender is specified for section 1. Some messages are based on a comparison to data from the previous year. In section 2 (benefits), some of the messages are based on an expectation that most faculty will be covered by retirement and medical plans; if the N in specific ranks is very small, these messages may appear even though the data are correct.</p>

<p><b>Submit survey</b></p>

<p>When each data section has been verified as &quot;signed off,&quot; the &quot;Submit&quot; button will appear. Once you have submitted the survey it will be reviewed by AAUP Research; you will be notified by e-mail when the survey has been approved, or when further review is necessary.</p>

<h2>Instructions for completing Institutional Information</h2>

<p><b>Institution name and address</b> - The institution full name and abbreviated publication name cannot be edited here; if the name has changed, please click the &quot;Request Change&quot; link to open an e-mail message to let us know. We will change the name and edit the publication version at the same time. Make any necessary changes to the address fields; note that this is the physical location of the institution, not your personal contact address.</p>

<p><b>Affiliation/Control and AAUP Category</b> - These items are basic institutional classifications and are not editable. Descriptions of the AAUP survey categories are linked for your reference, and include the data we will need to make a change. If you need to change either of these items, click the &quot;Request Change&quot; link to open an e-mail message to AAUP Research.</p>

<p><b>Professional schools or programs</b> - For each professional school or program listed, enter the number of faculty included from that school or program in this year&#39;s Section I salary and tenure status data. If you cannot specify the number, but faculty from that school or program are included in the Section I data, check the corresponding box. The listing of schools/programs is not meant to be exhaustive, but is a consistent set used each year.</p>

<p><b>Campus</b> - If your institution has only one campus, you do not need to add any information in this field. If you previously supplied multiple campus names, that information has been brought over from our previous database. Please check and correct it. You can edit or delete the campus names that are pre-filled; this information is specific for the current survey year and will not affect previous years. If you need to delete a campus, please use the &quot;Remove&quot; link on that line, rather than the simply removing the name with the &quot;Update&quot; feature. If you need to add an additional campus, click &quot;Add New Record.&quot; Please add each campus separately.</p>

<p><b>Convention for campus names</b> - Give only the location or name of the campus (e.g., &quot;Piney Hills&quot; or &quot;Euclid P. Smith&quot;). Do not include the word &quot;campus.&quot; If the campus is in a different state from your institution&#39;s main location, or if you have additional campuses in more than one state, add the state abbreviation (i.e., &quot;Piney Hills, MD&quot;).</p>

<p><b>Sign off or notify</b> - Sign off under &quot;Confirm and Save&quot; when the institutional information is complete. (You must sign off here in order to upload data via Excel.) You may also use the date control to notify AAUP Research of a delay in submitting data, or the checkbox for non-participation this year. If you check the &quot;will not submit&quot; item, you will not receive further follow-up reminders.</p>

<h2>nstructions for completing Section 1:</h2>

<h2>Number, Total Salaries, and Tenure Status of Full-Time Instructional Faculty</h2>

<p><b>Length of contract</b> Data for those whose base contract requires 9 or 10 months of instruction (e.g., two semesters, three quarters, or two trimesters) should be reported in Part (a) regardless of whether the pay period extends over 9 or 12 months. Data for those on 11- or 12-month contracts should be reported in Part (b) in full (i.e., without conversion to the 9-month equivalent).</p>

<p><b>Conversion Factor</b> Completion of this field is necessary only if you report data for 11- or 12-month faculty. Enter the factor to be used to convert 12-month amounts to a 9-month equivalent; the default value is 9/11 or 0.81818181818. This factor will automatically convert 12-month amounts for the totals in Part (c) once you click &quot;Save.&quot; (N.B. If you have 12-month faculty, we request that you complete both parts (a) and (b) in each section and utilize our conversion routines, rather than converting the data yourself. If you still prefer to convert the data yourself, please enter the converted total figures in part (a) of each section and add a comment in section 1 to that effect.)</p>

<p><b>Faculty Members Included in Survey</b> Report full-time faculty members for the entire institution, excluding clinical or basic science faculty located in schools of medicine. For the purpose of this survey, include all members of the instructional/research staff who are employed full-time and whose major (at least 50%) regular assignment is instruction (including released time for research), regardless of whether they are formally designated &quot;faculty.&quot; Faculty on sabbatical leave should be reported at their regular salaries even though they may be receiving a reduced salary while on leave. Replacements for those on leave with pay should not be reported; replacements for those on leave without pay should be. All faculty members who have contracts for the full academic year should be included, regardless of whether their status is considered &quot;permanent.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Exclusions</b> Do not include (1) faculty members who are not employed on a full-time basis; (2) faculty members whose services are valued by bookkeeping entries rather than by full cash transactions unless their salaries are determined by the same principles as those who do not donate their services; (3) faculty members in military organizations and paid on a different scale from civilian employees; (4) faculty members whose appointment is in a medical school; (5) administrative officers with titles of dean, associate or assistant dean (but see FAQ), librarian, counselor, registrar, or coach, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction; and (6) graduate or undergraduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but who have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching associate, or teaching fellow.</p>

<p><b>Faculty Salary Outlays (Total Contracted Salaries)</b> Report the projected expenditure for full-time contracted salaries excluding extra loads, summer teaching, stipends, or other forms of remuneration. Department or program heads with faculty rank and no other administrative title should be reported at their instructional salary (i.e., excluding administrative stipends).</p>

<p><b>Tenure Status</b> The total number of faculty should be divided into three mutually exclusive categories: Not on tenure track; on tenure track; and tenured. If your institution does not have a tenure system, please enter the total number in the &quot;Not Tenure-Track&quot; column.</p>

<p><b>Totals and Averages</b> The application will total columns and calculate averages once you click &quot;Save&quot;; please verify that these figures are correct and report any discrepancies immediately to AAUP Research.</p>

<p>
    <h2>Instructions for completing Section 2:</h2>

    <h3>Major Benefits for Full-Time Instructional Faculty</h3>

    <p>Report the projected benefit expenditures that will be paid by the institution or state for full-time instructional faculty reported in Section 1. The employee&#39;s contribution should not be included when determining the dollar value of benefits. When expenditure is reported for a given benefit, the number of persons covered should also be reported. In the case of tuition, this is the number of actual recipients (faculty members) rather than the number of faculty eligible.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> If you are not able to produce benefit outlay data by rank, you can submit total expenditures for each item. Using the Excel data file, enter your data in the &quot;Undifferentiated Rank&quot; column only. Entering data directly online, click the &quot;yes&quot; button at the top of the screen in response to &quot;Does this institution aggregate benefits data, so that they are not broken out by faculty rank?&quot; The screen will adjust so that only the &quot;Undifferentiated Rank&quot; column is visible.</p>

    <p><b>Retirement</b> Include the contribution by the institution, state, and/or local government to the retirement plan(s) but exclude payments for unfunded retirement liability. (See the FAQ regarding Emeriti or other retirement health insurance plans.)</p>

    <p><b>Medical</b> Include premiums for insurance plans which provide medical, hospital, surgical, and/or vision benefits.</p>

    <p><b>Dental</b> Include premiums for dental insurance.</p>

    <p><b>Combined Med/Dental</b> This line allows for reporting medical and dental insurance expenditures combined. We prefer to receive these items separately, but this line is for institutions who are not able to separate the two expenses. (Do not complete this line if you report the items separately.)</p>

    <p><b>Disability</b> Include expenditures, through insurance or otherwise, for long-term disability income protection, defined as salary in excess of six months and not covered in other retirement or insurance plans. Do not include payments for accumulated unused sick leave.</p>

    <p><b>Tuition</b> Include both cash payments and the dollar value of tuition waivers and exchanges for faculty dependents. Note that for tuition, the number covered is the number of actual recipients (faculty members) rather than the number of faculty eligible.</p>

    <p><b>FICA</b> Include Social Security (OASDI and Medicare) taxes calculated at the rate effective for the current year.</p>

    <p><b>Unemployment</b> Include the unemployment compensation taxes (not the benefits) to be paid by law.*</p>

    <p><b>Group Life</b> Include expenditures by the institution for life insurance premiums.</p>

    <p><b>Worker Comp</b> Include the worker&#39;s compensation insurance premiums (not the benefits) paid, including any premiums or taxes required under state law.*</p>

    <p><b>Other</b> Include benefits in-kind with cash alternatives. These benefits are those for which the institution provides an option of taking a cash payment if the individual prefers to use the money in some other way. Since the objective is the measurement of income available for personal consumption, as distinct from professional purposes, professional benefits (e.g., conference travel, membership fees, grading assistance, faculty clubs, etc.) should not be included.</p>

    <p><b>Total</b> Expenditure columns will total automatically. The total number covered is an unduplicated count, not the sum of those covered by individual benefits. The spreadsheet will automatically determine the maximum number in each column.</p>

    <p><b>*Notes:</b> If the institution is self-insured for unemployment and/or worker&#39;s compensation, report the estimated amount which would otherwise be paid to the state under these laws.</p>

    <p><b>Conversion</b> Benefit expenditure amounts for 11 and 12 month faculty that are not generally figured as a percentage of salary are not converted. These include medical, dental, disability, tuition, unemployment, and &quot;other&quot; benefits. Other items will be converted using the factor entered in section 1. If you provided only converted salary figures in Section 1, please follow the same procedure in Section 2. If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:aaupfcs@aaup.org?Subject=Question%20on%20FCS%20section%202">contact AAUP Research.</a>.</p>


<h2>Instructions for completing Section 3:</h2>

<h3>Salaries and Percentage Increase for Continuing Full-Time Instructional Faculty</h3>

<p>In the &quot;Number Of Continuing Faculty&quot; column, include only those specific individual 2013-14 faculty members who remain employed full-time at your institution for 2014-15. Entirely omit faculty from section 3 if they are: new appointees; faculty who left at the end of 2013-14; and those who did not have the same length contract in both years (unless the second is prorated to the same length as the first). Where a faculty member received a promotion in rank for 2014-15, that individual&#39;s salary should be reported under last year&#39;s rank in both salary outlay columns. The percentage change will calculate automatically when you click &quot;Save.&quot; It is intended to include promotions as well as individual and across-the-board increases.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> A negative change in this section would mean that the individuals in a particular rank took an overall cut in salary, which is not generally the case. Please verify that you are reporting salary for the same individuals in both the &quot;Current Year&quot; and &quot;Previous Year&quot; columns, and that the salaries are for the same contract length. If an individual held an administrative appointment in the previous year, it would be preferable to report salary for the previous year without any additional administrative stipend.</p>

<p>If you have questions on this section, please <a href="mailto:aaupfcs@aaup.org?Subject=Question%20on%20FCS%20section%203">contact AAUP Research.</a></p>

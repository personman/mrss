<p>Clicking the text <a href="https://research.aaup.org/">the Faculty Compensation Survey</a> will direct the user to the Faculty Compensation Survey portal main page, upon which the user&nbsp;will be asked to provide a username and password. &nbsp;The username will be the user&nbsp;institutional e-mail account (e.g. bullwinkle.moose@wossamotta.edu). &nbsp;The below link received in the e-mail will provide the user the opportunity to create or reset their password. &nbsp;If a user receives this e-mail, they do not need to first visit the Faculty Compensation Survey portal main page first. &nbsp;Rather, the user may simply click the user reset password link. &nbsp;The AAUP Research Office will never have access to a user&nbsp;password. &nbsp;If a user&nbsp;ever forgets their password, the user&nbsp;may obtain a new password by clicking the &quot;<a href="https://research.aaup.org/reset-password">Get a new password</a>&quot; link on the username and login screen.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Faculty Compensation Survey User Access</h1>

<p>Whether the user&nbsp;receives an invitation from the AAUP Research Office announcing the start of the Faculty Compensation Survey for the current year, or the user is&nbsp;newly added to the institution by the primary contact for the institution, the user will&nbsp;receive an e-mail resembling&nbsp;the below screen capture to initiate access to the Faculty Compensation Survey portal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Clicking the text <a href="https://research.aaup.org/">Faculty Compensation Survey</a> will direct the user to the Faculty Compensation Survey portal main page, upon which the user&nbsp;will be asked to provide a username and password. &nbsp;The username will be the user&nbsp;institutional e-mail account (e.g. bullwinkle.moose@wossamotta.edu). &nbsp;The link received in the e-mail will provide the user the opportunity to create or reset their password. &nbsp;If a user receives this e-mail, they do not need to first visit the Faculty Compensation Survey portal main page first. &nbsp;Rather, the user may simply click the user reset password link. &nbsp;The AAUP Research Office will never have access to a user&nbsp;password. &nbsp;If a user&nbsp;ever forgets their password, the user&nbsp;may obtain a new password by clicking the &quot;<a href="https://research.aaup.org/reset-password">Get a new password</a>&quot; link on the username and login screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Welcome email with password reset link." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/welcome-bullwinkle.jpg" style="line-height: 1.6em; border: 2px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Starting the Faculty Compensation Survey</h1>

<p>Once the user&nbsp;has&nbsp;obtained access to the Faculty Compensation Survey with a valid username and password, the user will need to click the green &quot;Start&quot; tab on the menu immediately below the AAUP Faculty Compensation Survey banner. &nbsp;The below screen capture provides a depiction of the location.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Homepage showing Start button in menu." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/start.jpg" style="line-height: 1.6em; border: 2px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);" /></p>

<p>Once the user has clicked the &quot;Start&quot; tab, a Terms and Conditions form should appear for first-time users of the site as well as users beginning the Faculty Compensation Survey each year. &nbsp;The AAUP Faculty Compensation Survey Terms and Conditions have long been implicitly associated with the survey and explicitly stated since the 2014 - 2015 data collection cycle. &nbsp;The below screen capture provides a full version of the AAUP Faculty Compensation Survey Terms and Conditions. &nbsp;Once the user has agreed to the Terms and Conditions by clicking the agreement and authorization boxes, and provided a typed (digital) signature and position title, the user will be directed to the AAUP Faculty Compensation Survey main page for users. &nbsp;From that page, the user will be provided a menu of options for the Faculty Compensation Survey portal dependent upon their user account access level. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Terms and conditions." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/terms-and-conditions.jpg" style="line-height: 1.6em; border: 2px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);" /></p>

<h1><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">Downloading and Uploading the Faculty Compensation Survey</span></h1>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Once the user has accepted the AAUP Faculty Compensation Survey Terms and Conditions, the user will be redirected to the AAUP Faculty Compensation Survey portal main page. &nbsp;The &quot;Start&quot; tab will be replaced by a &quot;Data Collection&quot;, which allows a user to view survey instructions, download or upload the Faculty Compensation Survey, review survey data, or manually enter survey data on each appropriate form.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Selecting &quot;Template&quot; under the &quot;Data Collection&quot; tab will allow the user to download a clean, pre-populated version of fields in Form 1: Institutional Information. &nbsp; <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">The below screen capture below provides a description of the download and upload page. &nbsp;Downloading the Faculty Compensation Survey</span>&nbsp;may take several minutes to download because the file is being pre-populated by prior institutional information. &nbsp;If the user is unable to successfully download the template via the &quot;Template tab, a clean version, without pre-populated data is available by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aaup.org/file/AAUP%20Faculty%20Compensation%20Survey%20-%202015-2016%20-%20Final.xlsx">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Faculty Compensation Survey template may also be uploaded on the &quot;Template&quot; page. &nbsp;<strong>Uploading a template into the Faculty Compensation Survey will overwrite any data previously entered manually on any of the six forms for that data collection cycle year.</strong> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Before uploading the template into the portal, please make sure that all numeric fields have numeric values&nbsp;(e.g. &quot;Conversion Factor&quot; should read 0.818181&nbsp;not 9/11). &nbsp;Please do not use formulas in place of numeric values (e.g. use 200,000 not 100,000 + E7). &nbsp;Please do not use text values in place of absent data (e.g. If the institution does not offer a supplement to the President/Chancellor leave the cell blank not &quot;NA&quot;). &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">To upload the Faculty Compensation Survey template into the portal, select the &quot;Choose File&quot; button on the &quot;Template&quot; page. The &quot;Choose File&quot; button will prompt the user to point the Faculty Compensation Survey to the present location of the Excel file to upload. &nbsp;Once the user selects the location of the file, the title of the file will appear in the Excel file location. &nbsp;Once the filename appears in the &quot;Choose File&quot; text box, please select the &quot;Upload&quot; button. &nbsp;Please click the upload button only once. &nbsp;The upload process may take up to three minutes to complete as the file is being uploaded into the Faculty Compensation Survey portal and checked against more than 50 Faculty Compensation Survey validation rules to improve institutional survey quality.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><img alt="The template upload page" class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/upload-help.jpg" style="line-height: 20.8px;" /></p>

<h1><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">Validating Faculty Compensation Survey Data</span></h1>

<p>Once Faculty Compensation Survey data has been uploaded, an overview of data collection should appear. &nbsp;Users electing to manually enter data in the portal or participating in quality review may view the overview of data collection by clicking on &quot;Overview&quot; which may be found under the &quot;Data Collection&quot; tab. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Overview tab allows users to view the estimated current progress on total survey completion as well as the total progress on each of the six Faculty Compensation Survey forms as depicted in the screen capture below. &nbsp;An institution need not reach 100 percent completion overall, or on any single form as some institutions may not be able to provide all possible fields. &nbsp;For example, an institution that does not employ any Graduate Teaching Assistants would not be able to complete any of the Graduate Teaching Assistant fields on Form 6: Part-Time Faculty Salary. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the Overview tab will also allow users to improve the quality of the Faculty Compensation Survey by reviewing any data issues identified by checking user institutional information against more than 50 validation rules within the Faculty Compensation Survey portal. &nbsp;<strong>A data issue does not necessarily indicate that an error in quality has occurred but rather, data reported are&nbsp;at variance with what is normally expected from findings produced by current and prior submissions from the Faculty Compensation Survey</strong>. &nbsp;If a potential data issue has been identified, a red bar will across the Overview page directly below the menu options as depicted in the screen capture below. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To review the potential data issue, simply click on the &quot;Please review&quot; hyperlink, which will direct the user to the potential issue or issues. &nbsp;If a data issue warning does not appear on the Overview page, it does not necessarily mean that there are no errors with the Faculty Compensation Survey, but rather, the validation rules failed to identify any of the most common data issues. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Data saved with one potential issue." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/upload-menu.jpg" style="line-height: 20.8px;" /></p>

<p>If an institution has a data issue, clicking on the &quot;Please review&quot; link in the warning band on the Overview page will direct the user to a list of data issues&nbsp;as depicted in the screen capture below. &nbsp;In the below example, the data issue reads &quot;Expenditure for Retirement is less than 5% of salary for Professor 9-Month.&quot; &nbsp;This data issue means that for the user&#39;s institution&nbsp;when comparing the average salary for the rank of Professor on nine-month contracts, the amount reported by the institution for retirement for Professors on nine-month contracts is less than five percent of the average total. &nbsp;</p>

<p>From the Data Issues page, the user has two options. &nbsp;The user may click &quot;Go to Form 3&quot; which will take the user to the appropriate form to review and if necessary, edit data within the portal. &nbsp;When editing data in the portal, please be sure to click &quot;Save&quot; at the bottom of the page when making changes. &nbsp;If the user uploaded data using a template and wishes to make a change in the template to have a duplicate record stored outside of the Faculty Compensation Survey portal, the user will need to again upload the template to register a template change. &nbsp;The user may also click the &quot;Confirm Data As Is&quot; if the user believes data are correct and that the possible issue does not apply to the user&#39;s institution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Example of data issues." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/data-issues.jpg" style="line-height: 20.8px;" /></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">If, after reviewing the data issue, the user believes data are accurate for their institution, the user should click on the &quot;Confirm Data As Is&quot; on the &quot;Data Issues&quot; page as identified in the screen capture above. &nbsp;Once the user clicks on the &quot;Confirm Data As Is&quot; button, a text box will appear next to the data issue requesting the user explain their confirmation of data over the data validation system as depicted in the screen capture below. &nbsp;A simple sentence explanation such as &quot;numerous Professors opt out of retirement at institution&quot; will suffice. &nbsp;In this instance, the user simply elected to write &quot;Verified as Accurate. BM.&quot; &nbsp;This text lets AAUP Research Office know that the primary contact was the user, (e.g. BM are initials for user &quot;Bullwinkle Moose&quot;) that reviewed the data issue and was able to validate the accuracy of the initial value. &nbsp;Once the user has entered text, the user must click the &quot;Save&quot; button to permit the Faculty Compensation Survey portal to test the change and update the data issues list for the institution.</span></p>

<p><img alt="Data issue verification." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/data-issues-verify.jpg" style="line-height: 1.6em;" /></p>

<p>Once the user clicks the &quot;Save&quot; button, the Faculty Compensation Survey updates the portal with the text response and tests any new values or the responses against the validation rules within the portal. &nbsp;After completing the validation checks, the system will update the Data Issues page. &nbsp;If there are no data issues, a message will appear state &quot;We have not found any issues with your data. &nbsp;Great work!&quot; as depicted in the screen capture below.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">A message with no data issue does not necessarily indicate&nbsp;that there were no data errors, but rather, no data reported are at variance from normally expected findings produced by current and prior submissions from the Faculty Compensation Survey</span><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">.&nbsp;It does mean that if there are any other issues to be identified, the primary contact user (Data Manager) will be contacted by the AAUP Research Office Staff. &nbsp;<strong>If there are no data issues, and the user is not contacted by AAUP Research Office Staff, no further action is required by the user for submission to the Faculty Compensation Survey on behalf of the institution for that year.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p><img alt="Data submitted with no issues." class="img-responsive" src="/images/aaup/data-no-issues.jpg" style="line-height: 1.6em;" /></p>

        <h4>Data Entry Requirements</h4>

        <p>We encourage every participating institution to submit as many data elements as possible. If you do not have data for a particular data element, you may leave that cell blank. However, the more data you provide, the better you will be able to benchmark your institution.</p>

        <p>The only&nbsp;mandatory data elements are located on Form 5 (highlighted by asterisks). Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you are not able to provide one of the mandatory data elements.</p>

        <h4>Finalizing Your Data</h4>

        <p>You do not need to lock or submit your data. We will automatically lock your account&nbsp;after the data verification process has been completed.</p>

        <p>As this is the first year of Maximizing Resources the data deadlines may be subject to extension to allow all members adequate time to participate.</p>

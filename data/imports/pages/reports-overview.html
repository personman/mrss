        <p>As an NCCBP member, you have unlimited access to your data so you can choose benchmarks, select peer institutions, and display reports.</p>

        <p>That means your researchers can slice reports to give you a dynamic view of how your community colleges compares to regional and national standards as well as to peer institutions, as defined by your criteriaâ€”enrollment, location, mission, size, and more.</p>

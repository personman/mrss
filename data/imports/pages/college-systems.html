        <p>For city, state, or regional community college systems, the National Community College Benchmark Project (NCCBP) provides a proven, relevant, and consistent yardstick to help colleges measure their progress.</p>

        <p>NCCBP helps researchers to pull consistent data about individual campuses and compare it against the whole system or <a href="/peers">peer institutions</a>. With <a href="/benchmarks">150+ benchmarks</a> and customized reports, researchers and leaders can use campus, regional, system- or statewide reports to serve as the foundation for continuous quality improvement.</p>

        <p>And with <a href="/how-to-join">special pricing</a>, campuses across college systems benefit not only from coordinated reporting, but also discounts.</p>

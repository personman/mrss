            <p>It isn&#39;t enough to show that your college is improving service to students. We must show that we are improving as fast as or faster than our peers across the nation. Participation in the NCCBP has been the foundation for our 10-year strategic plan. The NCCBP provides Des Moines Area Community College with accurate, comparative data on many key indicators of student success including retention and persistence rates, graduation rate, developmental education outcomes, staffing levels, and many others that we use to create our institutional scorecard. Many other initiatives have come and gone, but we always return the to NCCBP for what we need.</p>

            <p>We have found the NCCBP data to be most useful in preparing our Systems Portfolio for the Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP), our institutional accreditation pathway with the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).&nbsp; The HLC requires evidence not only of our own outcomes, but how we compare with other colleges.&nbsp; I know that our responses are complete because of the comparisons provided by the NCCBP.</p>

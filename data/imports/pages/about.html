        <p>The Workforce Training Benchmark Project provides community colleges with national metrics<span face=""> to express workforce division productivity and successes to internal and external stakeholders. </span></p>

        <p>Workforce Training and Continuing Education divisions across the country are under pressure to demonstrate their effectiveness. Divisions strive to establish a culture of evidence in which indicators of performance are regularly reviewed and data are collected to inform decision-making, planning, and improvement. The Workforce Training Benchmark Project&nbsp;offers community colleges consistent measures to express workforce division efficiency.</p>

        <p>The Workforce Benchmark&nbsp;Project was developed by the <a href="/National-Higher-Education-Benchmarking-Institute">National Higher Education Benchmarking Institute</a> at Johnson County Community College in conjunction with the National Council of Continuing Education &amp; Training (NCCET), is a national initiative to collect standardized information from community college workforce education divisions.</p>

            First year results from The Workforce Training Benchmark Project were finalized in August, 2014.  In addition to providing benchmark results to the members, the data can be used to help make strategic decisions necessary to improve workforce divisions. This white paper provides some insight into how much community colleges spend on promoting their workforce training programs.

        <h2>Changes in the 2014 NCCBP Reports</h2>

        <p><strong>Graphs:</strong> New for the 2014 reports are bar graphs for each benchmark which quickly gives you a snapshot of your college&#39;s performance compared to the national benchmarks. Members can either print the graphs or download them as images or PDFs and add them to reports for your college. To print or download the graphs, click on the <img alt="Icon for downloading charts" src="/images/chart-print-icon.png" />.</p>

        <p><strong>Peer Comparison Tool:</strong> The Benchmarking Institute has added a new feature to the peer comparison tool so that you can now save a peer group to use multiple times as you select benchmarks. Also, you will find that the benchmarks are now sorted by form making them easier for you to find.</p>

        <h2>Changes in the 2016&nbsp;NCCBP Data Collection</h2>

        <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>Form 2</strong> &ndash; After some confusion in the 2015 data collection on Form 2, we have reordered the data entry fields.&nbsp; We will now collect Completed AND DID NOT Transfer followed by Completed AND Transferred for each cohort.&nbsp; Next, we will show you the calculated total of these two data elements &ndash; the calculated total of the two data elements will be used in the graduation rate calculations.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Form 4</strong> &ndash; Data elements are now broken out by full-time and part-time students.&nbsp; This will allow us to report the persistence rate of both the full-time and part-time students as well as the overall persistence rate.</p>

        <p><strong>Form 11</strong> &ndash; We have added a section on Gateway Math.&nbsp; Gateway Math is for first-level math classes required for an associate&rsquo;s degree excluding college algebra, for example, statistics for business.</p>

        <p><strong>Form 12 and 17B</strong> &ndash; Please note that if your college does NOT offer P grades, you must&nbsp;enter a zero (0) in order for the benchmarks to be calculated.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

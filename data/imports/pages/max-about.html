    <h4>Align your community college&#39;s costs with student success.</h4>

        <p>State funding for community colleges is stagnant or shrinking, and yet there&#39;s growing pressure for institutions like yours to increase student enrollment, improve student outcomes, and better serve students with diverse educational needs.</p>

        <p>Developed with support from community colleges and funding from <a href="http://maximizingresources.org/partners">leading advocates in higher education</a>, Maximizing Resources for Student Success helps community colleges create a framework to support deliberate investments inyour students&#39; success.</p>

        <h4>Track the data that matters most to your students success.</h4>

        <p>How much do you spend on instruction, student services, and academic support?&nbsp; How do your costs compare with other peer institutions?&nbsp; Where do you overspend?&nbsp; Where are you underfunded?</p>

        <p>And the big question:&nbsp; How do those investments affect student outcomes?&nbsp; Or do they?</p>

        <p>Maximizing Resources for Student Success answers those questions.&nbsp; It uses <a href="http://maximizingresources.org/files/The%20ABCs%20of%20Activity-Based%20Costing%20in%20Community%20Colleges.pdf">activity-based costing </a>to provide your community college with national <a href="http://maximizingresources.org/Benchmarks">cost benchmarks </a>on instruction, student services, and academic support.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Capture the costs of your activities against key student outcomes.</li>
            <li>Compare your costs, allocations, and outcomes with other peer institutions.</li>
            <li>Allocate resources to activities with the highest beneficial impact on student outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Guide decision making, strategic planning, and process improvement.</h4>

        <p>Most phone book-sized college budgets are too complicated for decision-making and do not provide valid cost information. Activity-based costing offers a clear picture of all the elements that contribute to the cost of a specific activity.</p>

        <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Administrators can use the project&rsquo;s highly detailed data to:</span></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Allocate resources more effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Target specific initiatives.</li>
            <li>Guide long-term strategic planning.</li>
            <li>Educate policymakers on your mission and impact.</li>
        </ul>

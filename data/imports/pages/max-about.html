        <p>Maximizing Resources for Student Success provides community colleges with national <a href="/Benchmarks">cost benchmarks</a> on the following activities:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Instructional</li>
            <li>Student services</li>
            <li>Academic support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The project captures the cost of these activities in relationship to key student outcomes. The results allow institutions to align expenditures with their priorities.</p>

        <h4>Activity-Based Costing</h4>

        <p>Most phone book-sized college budgets are too complicated for decision-making and do not provide valid cost information. Activity-based costing offers a clearer picture of all the elements that contribute to the cost of a specific activity.</p>

        <p>Maximizing Resources for Student Success provides community colleges with national cost benchmarks on instructional, student services, and academic support activities. Community colleges use the benchmarking for decision making, strategic planning and process improvement.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>

<h4>How do I calculate the % of credit hours taught by full-time?</h4>

<p>Enter the total number of credit sections with six or more students taught by full-time faculty at the end of the reporting term divided by the total number of student credit hours taught.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Use the total number of student credit hours taught by full-time faculty at the end of the reporting term. This should be the number of credit hours for a course times the number of students enrolled in the course (include students who received a grade of W). For example, a 3 credit hour course with 30 enrolled students would generate 90 student credit hours. (Exclude high school students taking classes taught by high school faculty in their high schools for college credit.)</span></p>

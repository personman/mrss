        <p>The foundations of the National Higher Education Benchmarking Institute at Johnson County Community College were laid over 11 years ago.&nbsp; Initial funding was received from the Department of Educations&rsquo; Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE).&nbsp; This funding established &quot;The Kansas Study&quot;, which we now call the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncccpp.org" target="_blank">Cost and Productivity Project</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nccbp.org" target="_blank">National Community College Benchmark Project (NCCBP)</a>&nbsp;was conceived to take a &ldquo;balanced scorecard&rdquo; approach to community college benchmarking.</p>

        <p>Since 2004, over 450 community colleges have participated in the data-collection and reporting process for the projects. These projects make NHEBI the first and largest provider of community college benchmarking and peer comparison services in the nation.</p>

        <p>In addition to the two national data consortia mentioned above, the National Higher Education Benchmarking Institute at Johnson County Community College is currently working on two additional benchmarking projects: Workforce Training Benchmarking and this project.</p>

<div class="changes-header">
    <p>In a large data reporting project like the NCCBP, data entry errors are bound to happen due to the large number of participants and the sheer size of the NCCBP workbook fields.</p>

    <p>Under the old Excel workbook system, we had to reissue reports whenever major errors were detected. This new NCCBP website ensures that the version you see online is the most up to date report available. From now on we will correct all reported errors that are significantly affecting NCCBP Aggregate Reports.</p>

    <p>We will report them on this page to make corrections as transparent as possible.</p>

    <h2>Corrected equation for Total FY FTE Students</h2>
    <h4>December 5, 2013</h4>

    <p>On Form 20A, the computed field Total FY FTE Students had a problem in its equation that gave it a null result. This has been corrected and you can now see a value for it in submitted values. This issue did not affect any reports.</p>


    <h2>Clarified documentation for Form 4 field</h2>
    <h4>June 17, 2013</h4>

    <p>The following documentation was added to clarify the field "Fall 2011 Credit Students Who Enrolled in Spring 2012" on Form 4.</p>
    <p>Enter the total number of credit students from fall 2011 who enrolled in the spring 2012 term. Do not include students who graduated before spring 2012.</p>


    <h2>Corrected Form 15 Year Label</h2>
    <h4>February 11, 2013</h4>

    <p>On the national and regional reports, the Form 15 label, the year lagged two years behind instead of one. This issue has been resolved and applied to all previous year reports.</p>


    <h2>Form 19B Percentiles</h2>
    <h4>September 9, 2012</h4>

    <p>The percentile calculations for Form 19B have been addressed. If you have already downloaded NCCBP reports, you may wish to review the results for Form 19B.</p>


    <h2>First Generation Student - Form 1</h2>
    <h4>May 27, 2012</h4>

    <p>On Form 1- on small print- we had erroneously written 2009 as opposed to 2010 on the field titled "First Generation Students"</p>
    <p>We have corrected the issue.</p>



    <h2>Two or more races field missing initially</h2>
    <h4>February 11, 2012</h4>

    <p>The "Two or more races" field on Form 1 was missing in the initial version of the 2012 workbook. The issue has been resolved.</p>



    <h2>Method of Percentile Rank Calculation</h2>
    <h4>September 2, 2011</h4>

    <p>Some of you may be aware that there are many different ways of calculating percentiles. Originally, we had implemented a new percentile calculation method on this website. Most percentile calculation methods yield the same or very similar results (within +/- 1 percent) on large data sets (e.g. the National Report). On data sets including a lower number of cases, results can differ significantly.</p>
    <p>This is why we have decided to go back to the old NCCBP method of calculating percentiles. Please note that all percentile calculation methods have the potential to be imprecise as the number of cases decreases (e.g. in a small data set).</p>
    <p>Affected are most regional reports and to a lesser extent the National Report.</p>



    <h2>Number of Institutions in Some Regional Reports</h2>
    <h4>September 2, 2011</h4>

    <p>Some regional reports included all participating NCCBP colleges in the calculation of regional percentiles. This has been fixed.</p>
    <p>How do you know whether your downloaded version is up to date? In the affected reports the number of cases (n) was around 280. Please access the regional report if you are not sure whether you have downloaded the corrected version.</p>



    <h2>Form 16B, 16C: Incomplete Data Definition</h2>
    <h4>April 8, 2011</h4>

    <p>In Form 16B and Form 16C, the fields FTE Student and FT/PT Total Student Credit Hours Taught were missing the following documentation:</p>
    <p>"Exclude high school students taking classes taught by high school faculty in their high schools for college credit."</p>
    <p>The documentation has been added and all NCCBP subscribers will be notified of this change.</p>



    <h2>Missouri Aggregate Report</h2>
    <h4>March 18, 2011</h4>

    <p>In Form 16B and Form 16C, the fields FTE Student and FT/PT Total Student Credit Hours Taught were missing the following documentation:</p>
    <p>"Exclude high school students taking classes taught by high school faculty in their high schools for college credit."</p>
    <p>The documentation has been added and all NCCBP subscribers will be notified of this change.</p>

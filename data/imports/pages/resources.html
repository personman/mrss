            <p>
                Doña Ana Community College, an NCCBP member since 2006, made a strategic and financial decision to stop participating in national surveys to provide data elements to support our HLC study and instead find better ways to use the data supplied in the NCCBP and our internal surveys.  This presentation will share examples of how DACC has been able to use this approach to provide effective data support for our study.

                The National Community College Benchmarking Project (NCCBP) is a valuable data-rich source of information utilized in institutional strategic planning, program and policy improvement with applicable uses for institutional accreditation efforts which is not only beneficial at the institutional level, but can also drive and impact larger system-wide change at community college systems. The presentation will describe both the use of benchmarking data at the system-level with senior leadership and will share specific strategies for collaboration between system-level research staff and the unique needs of the college community.

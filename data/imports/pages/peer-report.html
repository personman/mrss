        <p>Find out how your community college compares to peer institutions across 150+ different benchmarks that you choose. Then, use that data to set goals, drive initiatives, frame realistic expectations&mdash;and demonstrate your commitment to your students and your academic mission. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>Compare benchmarks to other community colleges that submitted data. Your institution is identified by name while peer institutions are identified anonymously.</p>

        <p>You can select peers by name or by demographic characteristics, but individual college results remain confidential. Multiple peer groups can be identified and saved!</p>

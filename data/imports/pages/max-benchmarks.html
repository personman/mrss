<p class="page-intro">Track national cost benchmarks for instruction, student services, and academic support to align your costs with your student outcomes.</p>

<p>A recent survey from <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> revealed that 69 percent of college and university presidents believe that new spending will come from reallocated dollars. <a href="/about">Maximizing Resources for Student Success</a> helps your community college target those reallocations to programs and services with the highest student impact.</p>

<p>With national cost benchmarks for instruction, student services, and academic support, community college leaders can use this highly detailed data to align their costs with their priorities.</p>

<h4>Gain a clear picture of costs and outcomes by college, department, program, or even course.</h4>

<p>Maximizing Resources provides useful information to decision makers about what is really going on in their community colleges, giving you transparency and improved measurement.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Highlight resource needs (or surpluses).</li>
    <li>Reward effective and efficient departments.</li>
    <li>Target investments to maximize student impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can determine how faculty spend their time&mdash;across grading, advising, and tutoring&mdash;and use that data to realign activities to improve student outcomes.</p>

<h4>Compare costs, allocations, and outcomes within your institution and across peer institutions.</h4>

<p>Determine how you allocate your funding and then compare that distribution of funds between other academic units, among your campuses, with other peer institutions, or over time.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reallocate funds to better support your priorities.</li>
    <li>Compare how is spent on activities between academic units or among peer institutions.</li>
    <li>Compare your costs to select peers, by institution or demographic.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Educate policymakers and stakeholders on your mission and impact.</h4>

<p>Maximizing Resources gives you detailed data on how your investments align with your goals and your community&rsquo;s expectations. Comparing your data with other peer institutions also gives context to your investments, letting you see where you can reallocate resources for greater impact.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Compare costs with student outcomes.</li>
    <li>Evaluate ways you can improve existing programs.</li>
    <li>Allow for a more sustainable course and program mix.</li>
</ul>
